<h1>simpleAudioNavigator</h1>
<ul>
	<li>This program features a backward and forward button allowing the web user to cycle through the songs featured; in this case, I used 3 of my 
	favourite Jennifer Lopez songs.</li>
	<li>I did not include the audio files on GitHub as the songs are copyrighted works.</li>
	<li>Simply follow the naming conventions used in the 2 arrays inside changeSong(). The first array (trackListing) contains string values (file names) 
	that will be used to change the audio tag's 'src' attribute value and thus enable the intended song to be played, while the second array (actualName) 
	holds the song title written in conventional format (seen in media players).</li>
	<li>Ensure that the file format portion of trackListing's elements is always there and corresponds to the actual file format.</li>
